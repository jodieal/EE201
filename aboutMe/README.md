# About Me
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hi! My name is Jodie Alvinez. 

I'm a third year ECE student focusing on embedded systems. 

I've lived in WA basically my whole life though I somehow feel like I can never get used to the rain. 

My hobbies include sleeping in and playing rhythm games as of recent.  

Looking forward to learning more throughout the quarter!
