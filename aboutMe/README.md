# About Me
Hi! My name is Jodie Alvinez.

I'm a third year ECE student focusing on embedded systems. 

I've lived in WA basically my whole life though I somehow feel like I can never get used to the rain. 🌧️

My hobbies include sleeping in and playing rhythm games as of recent. 🎵 

Looking forward to learning more throughout the quarter! 😄
